= Introduction

Ikonli provides icon packs that can be used in Java applications. Currently Swing and JavaFX UI toolkits are supported.

== Download

Ikonli and all of its icon packs can be downloaded from Maven Central

You must select a binary that matches your target UI toolkit, such as

[horizontal]
Swing:: ikonli-swing-{project-version} (JDK 11+) _or_ ikonli-swing-{ikonliJdk8Version} (JDK 8)
JavaFX:: ikonli-javafx-{project-version} (JDK 11+) _or_ ikonli-javafx-{ikonliJdk8Version} (JDK 8)

WARNING: Not all icon packs are available in the JDK8 only version (`{ikonliJdk8Version}`).

Next, select any of the icon packs you want to use. You may select more than one for the same application.

== Breaking Changes

If you are upgrading to `12.0.0` or later be aware of the following changes:

* The module names moved from `org.kordamp.iconli` to `org.kordamp.ikonli.*`.
* The `icon-hawkconsfilled-pack` and `icon-hawkconsstroke-pack` icon packs were merged into a single `icon-hawkcons-pack` icon pack.
* The method `getCode()` of `org.kordamp.ikonli.Ikon` now returns `int` instead of `char`. This change is needed to accomodate
icon packs whose icon codes are larger than a single char, such as MaterialDesign.
* The interface `org.kordamp.ikonli.IkonHandler` no longer has a method `String getFontResourcePath()`; it has two new
methods instead: `URL getFontResource()` and `InputStream getFontResourceAsStream()`.
